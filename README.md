# Workshop slides

These are slides I use for my workshops at the [Ofahrt](https://www.fachschaft.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/studium/anfaenger/owo) of the computer science student representatives at TU Darmstadt.

`flakes` is about Nix Flakes, `rust` is about the very basics of Rust programming language.

## Building
Run `nix build .#<name>`, where `<name>` is one of the following: `flakes`, `rust` or `all`.

Alternatively, use [marp](https://marp.app/) as you see fit.
